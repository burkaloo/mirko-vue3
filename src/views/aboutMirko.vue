        <p>Mirko is the brainchild of two full-time working women with the desire  for hassle -free periods.</p>
        <p>With constant visits to the washroom and checking for leaks and stains, we noticed how menstruation causes inconvenience and disruption at work. This is the reason we decided to create our very first product under Mirko - the Period Panties (now Mirko’s Flow Underwear) - designed to keep women feeling secure all day long without the bulky feeling.</p>
        <p>We also discovered few options for sustainable period essentials in the Philippines and limited collective information on menstruation in contrast to western countries. This motivated our full commitment to breaking this taboo in Asian culture.</p>

        <h4 class="header-font fw-normal text-center my-5">BEAUTY</h4>
        <p>Good design includes a consideration for beauty which to us is captured in simplicity. With a minimalist approach, we leave room for women to boldly let their natural, raw beauty shine through.</p>

        <h4 class="header-font fw-normal text-center my-5">SEA</h4>
        <p>Taking a few steps back from our front lines, we understand the importance of first honoring the life force inside women - the ever deep, ever flowing, and every changing spirit we align with the sea. As women grow and transform, so too will our openness to changing and innovating.</p>
