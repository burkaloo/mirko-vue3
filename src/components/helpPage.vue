      <h2 class="header-font my-3">Return Policy.</h2>
      <p>
        Products in the feminine hygiene line may not be returned or exchanged due to sanitary reasons. If there are any concerns with the item (i.e. manufacturing faults), please contact us so we can look into it and provide the best solution. A special discount or replacement may be provided instead. Manufacturing faults should be reported to the Mirko team within 48 hours upon receipt of the item to be considered for replacement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Items that have been sent for alteration may not be returned, exchanged, or replaced.
      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2 class="header-font my-3">Replacements.</h2>
      <p>In case of replacement approval for damaged or faulty items, shipping fee to send a replacement will be shouldered by Mirko.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2 class="header-font my-3">Order Cancellation.</h2>
      <p>Orders may be cancelled at any time prior to payment. Cancellations will not be entertained once payment has been made to avoid errors in the operational flow.</p>

      <h2 class="header-font my-3">Delivery.</h2>
      <p>
        We ship out from Manila every MWF. Our standard delivery timeline is currently 3-5 days for Metro Manila and 5-7 days for provincial locations (except for very far flung areas). We also allow delivery via same-day delivery services within and near Metro Manila.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shipping fees will be shouldered by the buyer and paid with the item. Fees are P100 for Metro Manila Standard Delivery, Php 150 for provincial (Luzon), and P200 for Visayas and Mindanao areas. For same-day delivery, fees will be based on the app.
      </p>
